      <description>&lt;p&gt;Joint with Tsuyoshi Goto (Chiba University) and Yong-Rok Kim (Kobe University)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To promote monetary donations, government establish deductions depending on an amount of donations.
Especiaaly, in South Korea, deduction policy largely changed from tax deduction to tax credit in 2013.
This project analyzes the effect of this policy change on charitable giving and its heterogeneity,
using the panel data called National Survey of Tax and Benefit that
Korea Institute of Public Finance carried out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric information is a big issue in a charity market.
In the market, donors delegate production with third party interests to charities,
giving a part of wealth.
However, there is a case where donors cannot know how charities use their own money beforehand.
This project aims to clarify the effect of this asymmetric information with respect to productivity on
charity market, using a laboratory experiment called patron-dictator game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
